## 1. Introduction
EasyCart is a free, accessible web application made to help people create nice meals without the hassle of trying to find a specific recipe and what ingredients they need to pick up. Taking the time to create a shopping list can be time consuming in the working world where time is money. When it comes to groceries, staying healthy while saving time can be difficult, but there is an easier way to save time and reach your goals with EasyCart.  
EasyCart works by using Spoonacular’s API to search through Target’s API to find the ingredients needed for a chosen recipe. First the user searches for a recipe on EasyCart’s website, they choose a recipe that is appealing to them, then they can add the ingredients to their cart. This streamlines the experience of recipe making into a few simple steps, in order to facilitate ease in creating the recipe one loves.

## 2. Implemented requirements
Requirement: From our interviews people desired an easy to use UI that looks nice so we will work on making a nice design for the website.

Implemented by: Jabril Gray  
Approved by: Brandon Warman  
User Interface: An easy to use interface that allows the user to search for recipes.  

Requirement: First getting a recipe from spoonacular API and then checking to see if the items are available through Target API.

## 5. Lessons learned
Our team learned a lot with this second implementation. The first thing we learned in this new implementation is that our new landing pae is way more of a professional website then our old one. It is interesting to see how much better your project can get even when you think that it's at it best. Another thing we learned through this next implementation was that the python flask framework isn't too terribly difficult. It also makes it really easy to be able to hook up our front end UI design with our backend logic. What we would change if we were to continue this project is use a front end framework that works a lot better with our backend framework. This is because when you combine two powerful frameworks for applications it makes your application much faster and easier to read and understand as well. Throughout this second implementation in our meeting we've been able to discuss the problems we need to fix as well as discuss solutions to them. An example of this would be how to hookup the front end to the back end and we all agreed that the flask framework would work the best out of all the possible solutions to use. Overall throuhgout this project we have learned so much useful information as well as being able to do a lot of the work through github is going to help with our future professions in software engineering.
